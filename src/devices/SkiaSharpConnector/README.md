# SkiaSharp graphics library adapter

## Summary

This folder contains the SkiaSharp adapter for Iot.Device.Bindings. It provides an implementation for BitmapImage that uses the
[SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) multi-platform graphics library. This folder is compiled into its own .nuget file, so that no external dependencies
are included when they're not needed.

See [Ili934x](../Ili934x/Readme.md) for an usage example.
