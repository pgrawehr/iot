# Blink an LED with .NET on a Raspberry Pi

This [sample](Program.cs) demonstrates blinking an LED. The sample also demonstrates the most basic usage of the [.NET Core GPIO library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Device.Gpio). The [Blink multiple LEDs](../led-blink-multiple/README.md) sample demonstrates how to add more LEDS.

The following code toggles a GPIO pin on and off, which powers the LED.

```csharp
int pin = 18;
int lightTime = 1000;
int dimTime = 200;

using GpioController controller = new();
controller.OpenPin(pin, PinMode.Output);

while (true)
{
    controller.Write(pin, PinValue.High);
    Thread.Sleep(lightTime);
    controller.Write(pin, PinValue.Low);
    Thread.Sleep(dimTime);
}
```

The following [fritzing diagram](rpi-led.fzz) demonstrates how you should configure your breadboard to match the code above.

## Running in containers

You can run .NET GPIO apps in containers. This sample app includes a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) that you can build and run with the following commands:

```console
$ pwd
/home/pi/iot/samples/led-blink
$ docker build -t led-blink .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  13.31kB
Step 1/10 : FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build
// snip ...
$ docker run --rm --device /dev/gpiomem led-blink
```

Alternatively, you can run the container by mounting sysfs as a privileged container, but that's less secure and is a slower way to interact with GPIO pins.

```console
$ docker run --rm -v /sys:/sys --privileged led-blink
```
